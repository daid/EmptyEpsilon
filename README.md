EmptyEpsilon
============

Started as a Open source 'clone' of Spaceship Artemis - A bridge simulator. But has already deviated from the old spaceship artemis. It supports a game-master mode and multiple AI factions. We strive to get this working on all major platforms (Windows, Linux and Mac) but only windows support is guarenteed. 

The game is built on top of the SeriousProton engine and uses SFML for most of the heavy lifting. 

If there is anyone willing to contribute, we're mostly looking for awesome models, sound effects and music. The game will be tested regulary by some of our trusty colleagues. 


Contributing
===========
Some general contributing rules.
1. This project is a dictatorship. Yes it's open source, but we'd much rather spend time on building what we like then arguing with people. 
2. Be precise in your issues; Why do you post the issue, what do you expect, what is happening, why is your feature worth time, what operating system, etc. Issues that are not clear will be subject to rule 1. with extreme prejudice.
3. Despite the above two, input/ feedback / people playing this game is very much valued. If you have ideas/suggestings/ want to donate beer, drop a line.

Contributing (Donation)
===========
If you don't have the skills to help coding / create models, but you do want to give something back, you can always donate a bit. All donations will go directly towards buying better assets for the game (in this case; more/better 3D models). You can find the instructions on; http://daid.github.io/EmptyEpsilon/

Contributing (Coder)
============
If you are a coder and want to contribute, there are a few things to take into account. 
1. The code is a undocumented mess at this point. We're working on fixing that.
2. We use the following convention; member values are seperated with underscores, classes are with HighCamelCase and functions with lowCamelCase. 
3. Use a single pull request to change a single thing. Want to change multiple things? Multiple requests.

Contributing (Artist)
==============
There is no clear goal where this game is going. This means that there is no formal game / art / asset design. If you have something that you would like to see in this game (or want to make something), drop us a line. We'd love to see what you can do and how this game can improve.
