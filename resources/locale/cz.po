"The size of a sprawling town, stations at this scale represent a faction's "
"center of spaceborne power in a region. They serve many functions at once "
"and represent an extensive investment of time, money, and labor. A huge "
"station's shields and thick hull can keep it intact long enough for "
"reinforcements to arrive, even when faced with an ongoing siege or massive, "
"perfectly coordinated assault."
