Because the Atlantis X23 is fitted with a jump drive, it can also serve as an intersystem patrol craft.]]

atlantis = "Atlantis"
atlantisDescription = [[A refitted Atlantis X23 for more general tasks. The large shield system has been replaced with an advanced combat maneuvering systems and improved impulse engines. Its missile loadout is also more diverse. Mistaking the modified Atlantis for an Atlantis X23 would be a deadly mistake.]]

starhammerII = "Starhammer II"
starhammerIIDescription = [[Contrary to its predecessor, the Starhammer II lives up to its name. By resolving the original Starhammer's power and heat management issues, the updated model makes for a phenomenal frontal assault ship. Its low speed makes it difficult to position, but when in the right place at the right time, even the strongest shields can't withstand a Starhammer's assault for long.]]

kiriya = "Kiriya"
kiriyaDescription = [[Kiriya is an improved warp drive version of the Jump Carrier.]]

odin = "Odin"
odinDescription = [[The Odin is a "ship" so large and unique that it's almost a class of its own.

The ship is often nicknamed the "all-father", a name that aptly describes the many roles this ship can fulfill. It's both a supply station and an extremely heavily armored and shielded weapon station capable of annihilating small fleets on its own.

Odin's core contains the largest jump drive ever created. About 150 support crew are needed to operate the jump drive alone, and it takes 5 days of continuous operation to power it.

Due to the enormous cost of this dreadnaught, only the richest star systems are able to build and maintain ships like the Odin. 

This machine's primary tactic is to jump into an unsuspecting enemy system and destroy everything before they know what hit them. It's effective and destructive, but extremely expensive.]]

phobosT3 = "Phobos T3"
phobosT3Description = [[The Phobos T3, just like the Atlantis, is the workhorse of almost any navy. It's extremely easy to modify, which makes retro-fitting this ship a breeze. Its basic stats aren't impressive, but due to its modular nature, it's fairly easy to produce in large quantities.]]

phobosM3 = "Phobos M3"
phobosM3Description = [[The Phobos M3 is one of the most common variants of the Phobos T3. It adds a mine-laying tube, but the extra storage required for the mines slows this ship down slightly.]]

piranhaF12M = "Piranha F12M"
piranhaF12MDescription = [[This modified Piranha F12 is in all respects the same vessel except for special weapon tube modifications that allow it to fire nukes in addition to its normal loadout. However, these changes reduce its overall missile storage capacity.]]

piranhaF8 = "Piranha F8"
piranhaF8Description = [[The first version of the Piranha was not popular due to its meager firepower and odd tube configuration. The result was a huge financial failure.]]

piranha = "Piranha"
piranhaDescription = [[This combat-specialized Piranha F12 adds mine-laying tubes, combat maneuvering systems, and a jump drive.]]

hornetMT52 = "MT52 Hornet"
hornetMT52Description = [[The MT52 Hornet is a basic interceptor found in many corners of the galaxy. It's easy to find spare parts for MT52s, not only because they are produced in large numbers, but also because they suffer high losses in combat.]]

hornetMU52 = "MU52 Hornet"
hornetMU52Description = [[The MU52 Hornet is a new, upgraded version of the MT52. All of its systems are slightly improved over the MT52 model.]]

hornetMP52 = "MP52 Hornet"
hornetMP52Description = [[The MP52 Hornet is a significantly upgraded version of MU52 Hornet, with nearly twice the hull strength, nearly three times the shielding, better acceleration, impulse boosters, and a second laser cannon.]]

adderMK5 = "Adder MK5"
adderMK5Description = [[The Adder line's fifth iteration proved to be a great success among pirates and law officers alike. It is cheap, fast, and easy to maintain, and it packs a decent punch.]]

adderMK4 = "Adder MK4"
adderMK4Description = [[The mark 4 Adder is a rare sight these days due to the success its successor, the mark 5 Adder, which often replaces this model. Its similar hull, however, means careless buyers are sometimes conned into buying mark 4 models disguised as the mark 5.]]

adderMK6 = "Adder MK6"
adderMK6Description = [[The mark 6 Adder is a small upgrade compared to the highly successful mark 5 model. Since people still prefer the more familiar and reliable mark 5, the mark 6 has not seen the same level of success.]]

lindwormWX = "WX-Lindworm"
lindwormWXDescription = [[The WX-Lindworm, or "Worm" as it's often called, is a bomber-class starfighter. While one of the least-shielded starfighters in active duty, the Worm's two launchers can pack quite a punch. Its goal is to fly in, destroy its target, and fly out or be destroyed.]]

--stations
smallStation = "Small Station"
smallStationDescription = [[Stations of this size are often used as research outposts, listening stations, and security checkpoints. Crews turn over frequently in a small station's cramped accommodatations, but they are small enough to look like ships on many long-range sensors, and organized raiders sometimes take advantage of this by placing small stations in nebulae to serve as raiding bases. They are lightly shielded and vulnerable to swarming assaults.]]

mediumStation = "Medium Station"
