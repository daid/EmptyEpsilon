--[[                  Corvette
Corvettes are the common large ships. Larger then a frigate, smaller then a dreadnaught.
They generally have 4 or more shield sections. Run with a crew of 20 to 250.
This class generally has jumpdrives or warpdrives. But lack the manouverbility that is seen in frigates.

They come in 3 different subclasses:
* Destroyer: Combat oriented ships. No science, no transport. Just death in a large package.
* Freighter: Large scale transport ships. Most common here are the jump freighters, using specialized jumpdrives to cross large distances with large amounts of cargo.
* Support: Large scale support roles. Drone carriers fall in this category. As well as mobile repair centers.
