--	This utility can be used to place a station at a particular location of random size,
--	with a colorful name and description. If you write your station communications 
--	routines for it, the station will include various services, general station 
--	information and station history. If you define your station comms routine in function 
--	commsStation, placement will include setting the station to use that function.

--	Potential global variables that may interact with these functions:
--		function commsStation:
--			If defined, the placed station will be set to use it for communications
--		string stationFaction:
--			Station faction set to it if faction parameter is nil
--		table station_pool:
--			Defined here if not already defined. Helps avoid duplicate stations
--		table componentGoods:
--			Defined here if not already defined
--		table mineralGoods:
--			Defined here if not already defined
--		number difficulty:
--			Default to 1 (normal) if not already defined
--		table station_priority:
--			Defined here if not already defined. See populateStationPool

--	placeStation returns the station placed or nil if there was an error.
