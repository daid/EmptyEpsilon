--[[
Base of the ship templates, from here different classes of ships are included to be used within the game.
Each sub-file defines it's own set of ship classes.

These are:
* Stations: For different kinds of space stations, from tiny to huge.
* Starfighters: Smallest ships in the game.
* Frigates: Medium sized ships. Operate on a small crew.
* Covette: Large, slower, less maneuverable ships.
* Dreadnaught: Huge things. Everything in here is really really big, and generally really really deadly.

Player ships are in general large frigates to small corvette class
