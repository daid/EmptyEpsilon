--[[----------------BASE SHIP TEMPLATES---------------------
This file includes ship templates for each ship class to be
used within the game. Each sub-file also defines its own set
of ship subclasses.

These are:

* Stations: For different kinds of space stations, from tiny
    to huge.
* Starfighters: Smallest ships in the game.
* Frigates: Medium-sized ships that operate with a small
    crew.
* Corvettes: Large, slower, less maneuverable ships.
* Dreadnoughts: Huge things. Everything in here is really
    really big, and generally really really deadly.

Most player ships range from large frigates to small
corvettes.

Ktlitan ship templates are grouped into their own file and
do not have classes.
