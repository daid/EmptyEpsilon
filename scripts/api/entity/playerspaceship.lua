    return self
end
--- Commands this PlayerSpaceship to request a jump of the given distance.

--- If the scanning mini-game is enabled, this opens it on the relevant crew screens.
--- This command does NOT respect the player's ability to select the object for scanning, whether due to it being out of radar range or otherwise untargetable.
--- Example: player:commandScan(enemy)
function Entity:commandScan(target)
    commandScan(self, target)
    return self
end

end
--- Commands whether repair crews on this PlayerSpaceship automatically move to rooms of damaged systems.
--- Use this command to reduce the need for player interaction in Engineering, especially when combined with setAutoCoolant/auto_coolant_enabled.

--- Example: player:commandSetAutoRepair(true)
function Entity:commandSetAutoRepair(enabled)
    commandSetAutoRepair(self, enabled)
    return self
end

--- To convert the index to the value used by players, multiply it by 20, then add 400.
--- Valid values are 0 (400THz) to 20 (800THz).
--- Unlike SpaceShip:setShieldsFrequency(), this initiates shield calibration to change the frequency, which disables shields for a period.
--- Example:
--- frequency = ship:setShieldsFrequency(10) -- frequency is 600THz
function Entity:commandSetShieldFrequency(index)
    commandSetShieldFrequency(self, index)
    return self
end

    commandAddWaypoint(self, x, y)
    return self
end

function Entity:commandRemoveWaypoint(index)
    commandRemoveWaypoint(self, index)
    return self
end
--- Commands this PlayerSpaceship to move the waypoint with the given index to the given coordinates.

    commandCancelSelfDestruct(self)
    return self
end

--- Codes are 0-indexed. Index 0 corresponds to code A, 1 to B, etc.
--- Example: player:commandConfirmDestructCode(0,46223) -- commands submitting 46223 as self-destruct confirmation code A
function Entity:commandConfirmDestructCode(index, code)
    commandConfirmDestructCode(self, index, code)
    return self
end

end
--- Commands this PlayerSpaceship to set the given alert level.

            count = count + 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
--- Sets the total number of repair crews on this PlayerSpaceship.
--- If the value is less than the number of repair crews, this function removes repair crews.

function Entity:setRepairCrewCount(amount)
    if self.components.internal_rooms then
        for idx, e in ipairs(getEntitiesWithComponent("internal_crew")) do
            if e.components.internal_crew.ship == self then

                if amount < 0 then
                    e:destroy()
                end
            end
        end
        for n=1,amount do
            local crew = createEntity()
            crew.components.internal_crew = {ship=self}
