--- A SpaceShip is a ShipTemplateBasedObject controlled by either the AI (CpuShip) or players (PlayerSpaceship).
--- It can carry and deploy weapons, dock with or carry docked ships, and move using impulse, jump, or warp drives.
--- It's also subject to being moved by collision physics, unlike SpaceStations, which remain stationary.
--- This is the parent class of CpuShip and PlayerSpaceship objects, which inherit all STBO and SpaceShip functions.
--- Objects of this class can't be created by scripts, but its child classes can.

--- - index: Each beam weapon on this SpaceShip must have a unique index.
--- - arc: Sets the arc of its firing capability, in degrees.
--- - direction: Sets the default center angle of the arc, in degrees relative to the ship's forward bearing. Accepts 0, negative, and positive values.

--- - arc: Sets the turret's maximum targeting angles, in degrees. The turret arc must be larger than the associated beam weapon's arc.
--- - direction: Sets the default center angle of the turret arc, in degrees relative to the ship's forward bearing. Accepts 0, negative, and positive values.
--- - rotation_rate: Sets how many degrees per tick (unit?) that the associated beam weapon's direction can rotate toward the target within the turret arc. System effectiveness modifies the turret's rotation rate.
--- To create a turreted beam, also add SpaceShip:setBeamWeapon(), and set the beam weapon's arc to be smaller than the turret's arc.
