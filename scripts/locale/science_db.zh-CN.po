msgid """A black hole is a point of supercondensed mass with a gravitational pull so 
powerful that not even light can escape it. It has no locally detectable 
features, and can only be seen indirectly by blocking the view and 
distorting its surroundings, creating a strange circular mirror image of the 
galaxy. The black disc in the middle marks the event horizon, the boundary 
where even light can't escape it anymore. \n\t\nOn the sensors, a black hole appears as a disc indicating the zone where the 
gravitational pull is getting dangerous, and soon will be stronger then the 
ship's impulse engines. An object that crosses a black hole is drawn toward 
its center and quickly ripped apart by the gravitational forces."""
msgstr "黑洞是一个质量极度集中的点，其引力强大到连光都无法逃脱。它没有局部可探测的特征，只能通过间接的方式看到，比如阻挡视线并扭曲周围环境，从而形成一个奇怪的圆形镜像图像。中间的黑色圆盘标志着事件视界，即光也无法逃脱的边界。\n\t\n在传感器上，黑洞显示为一个圆盘，表示该区域的引力正在变得危险，并且很快会超过飞船的推进引擎力量。任何穿过黑洞的物体都会被拉向中心，并迅速被强大的引力撕裂。"
