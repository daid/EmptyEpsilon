# Scenario description
msgid ""
"Capture opposing team's \"flag\" before they capture yoursThe region "
"consists of two halves divided by a line of nebulae. The first 5 minutes "
"each side decides where to place their flag. The ships closest to the "
"referee station determine the team's flag location during the initial phase. "
"Crossing to the other side during this phase will result in ship "
"destruction. The weapons officer will mark the flag coordinates when the "
"ship reaches the flag location. After the 5 minute timer expires, an "
"artifact will be placed at the location representing the team's flag. If no "
"place has been marked, the ship's current location will be used. If the "
"location is outside the game boundaries, the flag will be placed at the "
"nearest in bound locationOnce the flags are placed, the hunt is on. Ships "
"may cross the border in search of the other team's flag, but while they are "
"in the other team's territory they may be tagged by an opponent ship within "
"1U. Being tagged sends you back to your own region with damage to your warp/"
"jump drive. Each flag must be scanned before it can be retrived. Retrieval "
"occurs by getting within 1U of the flag. Being tagged while in posession of "
"the flag drops the flag at the location of the tag event. Cross back to your "
"side with the flag to claim victory"
