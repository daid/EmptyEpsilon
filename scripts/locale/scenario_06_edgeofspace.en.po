# Scenario description
msgid ""
"You command the Technician Cruiser Apollo, a repair ship on the border of "
"dangerous space.The Apollo is outfitted with minimal weapons as there is a "
"cease-fire between the Human Navy and the neighboring Kraylor.You are tasked "
"with discovering the cause of damage on one of your deep space telescopes."
"This scenario is limited to one player ship: the Atlantis Apollo."

"Our edge-of-space telescope has been malfunctioning for the past few days. "
"We expect the cause to be a mechanical failure, but we want you to take a "
"look.\n"
"\n"
"The E.O.S. scope is on the border of Kraylor space, so maintain contact and "
"keep up long-range scans.\n"
"\n"
"Dock with the E.O.S. scope and investigate the damage. Transmitting your "
"report via standard communications channels is too dangerous given the "
"already delicate nature of our treaty with the Kraylor, so return to Central "
"Command to report your findings.\n"

"Reopen communications if you have any questions."
