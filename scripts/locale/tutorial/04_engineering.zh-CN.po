# Scenario description
msgid """[Station Tutorial]\n-------------------\n-Goes over controlling the power of each station and repairs.\n\n[Station Info]\n-------------------\nPower Management:\n-The Engineering officer can route power to systems by selecting a system \nand moving its power slider. Giving a system more power increases its \noutput. For instance, an overpowered reactor produces more energy, \noverpowered shields reduce more damage and regenerate faster, and \noverpowered impulse engines increase its maximum speed. Overpowering a \nsystem (above 100%) also increases its heat generation and, except for the \nreactor, its energy draw. Underpowering a system (below 100%) likewise \nreduces heat output and energy draw.\n\nCoolant Management:\n-By adding coolant to a system, the Engineering officer can reduce its \ntemperature and prevent the system from damaging the ship. The ship has an \nunlimited reseve of coolant, but a finite amount of coolant can be applied \nat any given time, so the Engineering officer must budget how much coolant \neach system can receive. A system's change in temperature is indicated by \nwhite arrows in the temperature column. The brighter an arrow is, the larger \nthe trend.\n\nRepairs:\n-When systems are damaged by being shot, colliding with space hazards, or \noverheating, the Engineering officer can dispatch repair crews to the system \nfor repairs. Each systems has a damage state between -100% to 100%. Systems \nbelow 100% function suboptimally, in much the same way as if they are \nunderpowered. Once a system is at or below 0%, it completely stops \nfunctioning until it is repaired. Systems can be repaired by sending a \nrepair crew to the room containing the system. Hull damage affects the \nentire ship, and docking at a station can repair it, but hull repairs \nprogress very slowly."""
