"[Station Tutorial]\n"
"-------------------\n"
"-Goes over controlling the power of each station and repairs.\n"

"[Station Info]\n"
"-------------------\n"
"Power Management:\n"
"-The Engineering officer can route power to systems by selecting a system "
"and moving its power slider. Giving a system more power increases its "
"output. For instance, an overpowered reactor produces more energy, "
"overpowered shields reduce more damage and regenerate faster, and "
"overpowered impulse engines increase its maximum speed. Overpowering a "
"system (above 100%) also increases its heat generation and, except for the "
"reactor, its energy draw. Underpowering a system (below 100%) likewise "
"reduces heat output and energy draw.\n"
"\n"
"Coolant Management:\n"
"-By adding coolant to a system, the Engineering officer can reduce its "
"temperature and prevent the system from damaging the ship. The ship has an "
"unlimited reseve of coolant, but a finite amount of coolant can be applied "
"at any given time, so the Engineering officer must budget how much coolant "
"each system can receive. A system's change in temperature is indicated by "
"white arrows in the temperature column. The brighter an arrow is, the larger "
"the trend.\n"
"\n"
"Repairs:\n"
"-When systems are damaged by being shot, colliding with space hazards, or "
"overheating, the Engineering officer can dispatch repair crews to the system "
"for repairs. Each systems has a damage state between -100% to 100%. Systems "
"below 100% function suboptimally, in much the same way as if they are "
"underpowered. Once a system is at or below 0%, it completely stops "
"functioning until it is repaired. Systems can be repaired by sending a "
"repair crew to the room containing the system. Hull damage affects the "
"entire ship, and docking at a station can repair it, but hull repairs "
"progress very slowly."
