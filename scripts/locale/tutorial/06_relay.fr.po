"[Station Tutorial]\n"
"-------------------\n"
"-Goes over relay station.\n"
"\n"
"[Station Info]\n"
"-------------------\n"
"Sector Map:\n"
"-The Relay station can view a map of the sector, including space hazards and "
"ships within short-range scanner range (5U). It can also see the short-range "
"sensor data around other friendly ships and stations, potentially spotting "
"distant ships before the science station does. The Relay officer cannot scan "
"ships, however.\n"
"\n"
"Probes:\n"
"-The Relay officer can launch up to 8 high-speed probes to any point in the "
"sector. These probes fly toward a location and transmit short-range sensor "
"data to the ship for 10 minutes. Probes work inside nebulae, and thus are "
"powerful tools when faced with an area blocked by nebula. The Relay officer "
"can also link a probe's sensors to the Science station, which lets the "
"Science officer scan ships within the probe's sensor range even if the probe "
"is beyond the ship's long-range scanners. Probes cannot be retrieved and can "
"be destroyed by enemies; your ship's stock of probes can be replenished only "
"by docking at a station.\n"
"\n"
"Waypoints:\n"
"-The Relay officer can set waypoints around the sector. These waypoints "
"appear on the Helms officer's short-range scanner and can guide the ship "
"toward a destination or on a specific route through space. Waypoints are "
"also necessary when requesting aid from friendly stations.\n"
"\n"
"Communications:\n"
"-The Relay officer can open communications with stations and other ships. "
"Friendly ships hailed by the Relay officer can take orders, and friendly "
"stations can dispatch backup and supply ships. While your ship is docked at "
"a station, the Relay officer can request rearmament of the ship's missiles "
"and mines. Some of these requests can cost some of your crew's reputation, "
"which is also tracked by the Relay station."
