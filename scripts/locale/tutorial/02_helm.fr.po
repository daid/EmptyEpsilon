"[Station Tutorial]\n"
"-------------------\n"
"-Goes over controlling movement of the ship.\n"
"\n"
"[Station Info]\n"
"-------------------\n"
"Data:\n"
"-In the upper-left corner, the Helms officer's screen displays the ship's "
"energy (max is 1,000), current heading in degrees, and current speed in "
"Units/minute. Below this data are two sliders.\n"
"\n"
"Engines:\n"
"-The left slider controls the impulse engines, from -100% (full reverse) to "
"0% (full stop) to 100% (full ahead). The right slider controls the ship's "
"high-speed warp or instantly teleporting jump drives, if the ship is "
"equipped with either.\n"
"-Setting a Heading: The Helms officer has a short-range radar. Pressing "
"inside this radar sets the ship's heading in that direction. If the ship has "
"beam weapons, the radar view includes those weapons' firing arcs to help the "
"Helms officer keep targets in the Weapons officer's sights.\n"
"\n"
"Jumping:\n"
"-A jump drive teleports the ship across the specified distance along its "
"current heading. The ship's impulse engines shut down, and after a countdown "
"the ship disappears from its position and instantly reappears at its "
"destination. Each jump consumes energy, with longer jumps consuming more "
"energy. A standard jump takes 10 seconds to initiate, but depending on how "
"much power is allocated to the drive (and how damaged it is), the time to "
"power the jump might vary.\n"
"\n"
"Warping:\n"
"-A warp drive propels the ship straight ahead several times faster than "
"impulse engines, but drain energy at a much faster rate. A warping ship can "
"still collide with hazards like asteroids and mines, but a ship can enter "
"warp very quickly for rapid escapes and advanced tactical maneuvers.\n"
"\n"
"Combat Maneuvers:\n"
"-For ships capable of performing combat maneuvers, the Helms screen includes "
"up to two special sliders at the bottom right. The vertical slider rapidly "
"increases the ship's forward speed above its maximum cruising speed, but "
"generates lots of heat in the impulse engines and consumes energy quickly. "
"The horizontal slider moves the ship laterally but can quickly overheat the "
"maneuvering system. Combat maneuvers can be exhausted but recharge over "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"Docking:\n"
"-The Helms officer can dock with a friendly or neutral station (or in some "
"cases, a larger ship) when it is within 1U. While docked, the ship can't "
"engage its engines or fire weapons, but its energy recharges faster, repairs "
"take less time, the ship's supply of probes is replenished, and the Relay "
"officer can request missile weapon rearmament. The Helms officer is also "
"responsible for undocking the ship.\n"
"\n"
"Retrieving Objects:\n"
"-The Helms officer is also responsible for piloting the ship into supply "
"drops and other retrievable items to retrieve them."
