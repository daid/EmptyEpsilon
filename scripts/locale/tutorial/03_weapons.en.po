"[Station Info]\n"
"-------------------\n"
"Data:\n"
"-In the upper-left corner, the Weapons officer's screen displays the ship's "
"energy (max is 1,000), and the strength of its front and rear shields.\n"
"\n"
"Targeting:\n"
"-To fire beam weapons and target guided missile weapons, the Weapons officer "
"can select ships on the screen's short-range radar.\n"
"\n"
"Missiles:\n"
"-Missiles are one of a ship's most destructive weapons. Before a missile can "
"be fired, the Weapons officer selects it, then selects one of the weapon "
"tubes to load it. Loading and unloading weapon tubes takes time. Mines are "
"also loaded into a special type of weapon tube. Weapon tubes face a specific "
"direction, and some ships only have tubes on certain sides of a ship, making "
"cooperation with the helms officer's maneuvers especially important.\n"
"-To fire a missile, the Weapons officer presses a loaded missile tube. "
"Except for HVLIs, missiles home in on any target selected by the Weapons "
"officer. Otherwise, the missile is dumb-fired and flies in a straight line "
"from its tube. The Weapons officer can choose to lock the tube's aim onto a "
"target or click the Lock button to the top right of the radar to manually "
"angle a shot.\n"
"\n"
"Weapon Types:\n"
"Homing:\n"
"-A simple, high-speed missile with a small warhead.\n"
"Nuke:\n"
"-A powerful homing missile that deals tremendous damage to all ships within "
"1U of its detonation.\n"
"Electromagentic Pulse (EMP):\n"
"-A homing missile that deals powerful damage to the shields of all ships "
"within 1U of detonation, but doesn't damage physical systems or hulls.\n"
"High-velocity Lead Impactor (HVLI):\n"
"-A group of 5 simple lead slugs fired in a single burst at extremely high "
"velocity. These bolts don't home in on an enemy target.\n"
"Mine:\n"
"-A powerful, stationary explosive that detonates when a ship moves to within "
"1U of it. The explosion damages all objects within a 1U radius.\n"
"Beam Weapons:\n"
"-The location and range of beam weapons are indicated by red firing arcs "
"originating from the players' ship. After the Weapons officer selects a "
"target, the ship's beam weapons will automatically fire at that target when "
"it is inside a beam's firing arc. The officer can use the frequency "
"selectors at the bottom right, along with data about a target's shield "
"frequencies provided by the Science officer, to remodulate beams to a "
"frequency that deals more damage. Note that you can change the beam "
"frequency instantaneously.\n"
"-Beam weapons fire at a target's hull by default, but the Weapons officer "
"can also target specific subsystems to disable an enemy. If you simply wish "
"to destroy an enemy, however, it's best left on hull.\n"
"\n"
"Shields: The Weapons officer is responsible for activating the ship's "
"shields and modulating their frequency. It might be tempting to keep the "
"shields up at all times, but they drain significantly more power when "
"active. Certain shield frequencies are especially resistant to certain beam "
"frequencies, which can also be detected in targets by the Science officer. "
"Unlike beam weapons, however, remodulating the shields' frequency brings "
"them offline for several seconds and leaves the ship temporarily defenseless."
