"[Station Tutorial]\n"
"-------------------\n"
"-Goes over science station.\n"
"\n"
"[Station Info]\n"
"-------------------\n"
"Long-range Radar:\n"
"-The Science station has a long-range radar that can locate ships and "
"objects at a great distance. The Science officer's most important task is to "
"report the sector's status and any changes within it. On the edge of the "
"radar are colored bands of signal interference that can vaguely suggest the "
"presence of objects or space hazards even further from the ship, but it's up "
"to the Science officer to interpret them.\n"
"\n"
"Scanning:\n"
"-You can scan ships to get more information about them. The Science officer "
"must align two of the ship's scanning frequencies with a target to complete "
"the scan. Most ships are unknown (gray) to your crew at the start of a "
"scenario and must be scanned before they can be identified as a friend "
"(green), foe (red), or neutral (blue). A scan also identifies the ship's "
"type, which the Science officer can use to identify its capabilities in the "
"station's database.\n"
"\n"
"Deep Scans:\n"
"-A second, more difficult scan yields more information about the ship, "
"including its shield and beam frequencies. The Science officer must align "
"both the frequency and modulation of each scan type to complete a deep scan. "
"The helms and weapons screen can also see the firing arcs of deep-scanned "
"ships, which help them guide your ship from being shot by their beams.\n"
"\n"
"Nebulae:\n"
"-Nebulae block the ship's long-range scanner. The Science officer cannot see "
"what's inside or behind them, and while in a nebula the ship's radars cannot "
"detect what's outside of it. These traits make nebulae ideal places to hide "
"for repairs or stage an ambush. To avoid surprises around nebulae, relay "
"information about where you can and cannot see objects to both the Captain "
"and the Relay officer.\n"
"\n"
"Probe View:\n"
"-The Relay officer can launch probes and link one to the Science station. "
"The Science officer can view the probe's short-range sensor data to scan "
"ships within its range, even if the probe is far from the ship's long-range "
"scanners or in a nebula.\n"
"\n"
"Database:\n"
"-The Science officer can access the ship's database of all known ships, as "
"well as data about weapons and space hazards. This can be vital when "
"assessing a ship's capabilities without a deep scan, or for help navigating "
"a black hole, wormhole, or other anomaly."
