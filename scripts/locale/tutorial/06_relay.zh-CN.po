# Scenario description
msgid """[Station Tutorial]\n-------------------\n-Goes over relay station.\n\n[Station Info]\n-------------------\nSector Map:\n-The Relay station can view a map of the sector, including space hazards and \nships within short-range scanner range (5U). It can also see the short-range \nsensor data around other friendly ships and stations, potentially spotting \ndistant ships before the science station does. The Relay officer cannot scan \nships, however.\n\nProbes:\n-The Relay officer can launch up to 8 high-speed probes to any point in the \nsector. These probes fly toward a location and transmit short-range sensor \ndata to the ship for 10 minutes. Probes work inside nebulae, and thus are \npowerful tools when faced with an area blocked by nebula. The Relay officer \ncan also link a probe's sensors to the Science station, which lets the \nScience officer scan ships within the probe's sensor range even if the probe \nis beyond the ship's long-range scanners. Probes cannot be retrieved and can \nbe destroyed by enemies; your ship's stock of probes can be replenished only \nby docking at a station.\n\nWaypoints:\n-The Relay officer can set waypoints around the sector. These waypoints \nappear on the Helms officer's short-range scanner and can guide the ship \ntoward a destination or on a specific route through space. Waypoints are \nalso necessary when requesting aid from friendly stations.\n\nCommunications:\n-The Relay officer can open communications with stations and other ships. \nFriendly ships hailed by the Relay officer can take orders, and friendly \nstations can dispatch backup and supply ships. While your ship is docked at \na station, the Relay officer can request rearmament of the ship's missiles \nand mines. Some of these requests can cost some of your crew's reputation, \nwhich is also tracked by the Relay station."""
