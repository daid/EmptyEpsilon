# Scenario description
msgid """[Station Tutorial]\n-------------------\n-Goes over science station.\n\n[Station Info]\n-------------------\nLong-range Radar:\n-The Science station has a long-range radar that can locate ships and \nobjects at a great distance. The Science officer's most important task is to \nreport the sector's status and any changes within it. On the edge of the \nradar are colored bands of signal interference that can vaguely suggest the \npresence of objects or space hazards even further from the ship, but it's up \nto the Science officer to interpret them.\n\nScanning:\n-You can scan ships to get more information about them. The Science officer \nmust align two of the ship's scanning frequencies with a target to complete \nthe scan. Most ships are unknown (gray) to your crew at the start of a \nscenario and must be scanned before they can be identified as a friend \n(green), foe (red), or neutral (blue). A scan also identifies the ship's \ntype, which the Science officer can use to identify its capabilities in the \nstation's database.\n\nDeep Scans:\n-A second, more difficult scan yields more information about the ship, \nincluding its shield and beam frequencies. The Science officer must align \nboth the frequency and modulation of each scan type to complete a deep scan. \nThe helms and weapons screen can also see the firing arcs of deep-scanned \nships, which help them guide your ship from being shot by their beams.\n\nNebulae:\n-Nebulae block the ship's long-range scanner. The Science officer cannot see \nwhat's inside or behind them, and while in a nebula the ship's radars cannot \ndetect what's outside of it. These traits make nebulae ideal places to hide \nfor repairs or stage an ambush. To avoid surprises around nebulae, relay \ninformation about where you can and cannot see objects to both the Captain \nand the Relay officer.\n\nProbe View:\n-The Relay officer can launch probes and link one to the Science station. \nThe Science officer can view the probe's short-range sensor data to scan \nships within its range, even if the probe is far from the ship's long-range \nscanners or in a nebula.\n\nDatabase:\n"
