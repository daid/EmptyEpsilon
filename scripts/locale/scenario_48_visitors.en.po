# Scenario description
msgid ""
"Get rid of the unwanted visitors. Various other missions follow (check the "
"dispatch office). Missions may challenge the helm officer regardless of the "
"difficulty level chosen. You may choose to continue or stand down after each "
"mission.\n"
"\n"
"Running all missions can take several hours. Consider real life limits when "
"given the option to stand down at the end of each mission. Some missions are "
"easier to complete in a warp ship than in a jump ship. Only one of the last "
"set of missions may be selected.\n"
"\n"
"If you have already played one or more missions and want to choose to replay "
"or avoid a particular mission, choose a 'Selectable' variation. Choosing a "
"'Random' variation gives you no mission choice. The default is partial "
"selection control allowing you to select a mission group.\n"
"\n"
"Buttons on the Game Master screen can change the speed of objects in various "
"orbits by 10 percent per click\n"
"\n"
"If you are playing on a LAN and no longer want to hear voices from the "
"server running a main screen, change file scenario_48_visitors.lua in the "
"scripts folder such that 'server_voices = false' rather than 'server_voices "
"= true' on line 37. Note: case is important, so match the case in the lua "
"file, not what you see here (which is always upper case). After editing, you "
"will need to restart the server.\n"
