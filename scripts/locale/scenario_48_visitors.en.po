# Scenario description
msgid ""
"Get rid of the unwanted visitors. Various other missions follow (check the "
"dispatch office). Missions may challenge the helm officer regardless of the "
"difficulty level chosen. You may choose to continue or stand down after each "
"mission.Running all missions can take several hours. Consider real life "
"limits when given the option to stand down at the end of each mission. Some "
"missions are easier to complete in a warp ship than in a jump ship. Only one "
"of the last set of missions may be selected.If you have already played one "
"or more missions and want to choose to replay or avoid a particular mission, "
"choose a 'Selectable' variation. Choosing a 'Random' variation gives you no "
"mission choice. The default is partial selection control allowing you to "
"select a mission group.Buttons on the Game Master screen can change the "
"speed of objects in various orbits by 10 percent per clickIf you are playing "
"on a LAN and no longer want to hear voices from the server running a main "
"screen, change file scenario_48_visitors.lua in the scripts folder such that "
"'server_voices = false' rather than 'server_voices = true' on line 37. Note: "
"case is important, so match the case in the lua file, not what you see here "
"(which is always upper case). After editing, you will need to restart the "
"server.Voice Actors:Admiral U. E.David PriddyJordy KruijerKilted "
