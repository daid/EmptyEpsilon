msgid ""
"You command the Technician Cruiser Apollo, a repair ship on the border of "
"dangerous space.The Apollo is outfitted with minimal weapons as there is a "
"cease-fire between the Human Navy and the neighboring Kraylor.- You are "
"tasked with discovering the cause of damage on one of your deep space "
"telescopes."

"Apollo, Come in.\r\n"
"Our Edge-of-space telescope has been experiencing malfunctions over the "
"course of the past few days. We expect the cause to be a mechanical failure, "
"but we want you to take a look. \r\n"
"\r\n"
"The E.O.S Scope is right on the border of Kraylor space, so make sure to "
"maintain contact and keep up long-range scans. \r\n"
"\r\n"
"Dock with the E.O.S Scope and investigate the damage, then return to Central "
"Command to report your findings. Transmission of this report via standard "
"communications channels is considered too dangerous given the already "
"delicate nature of our treaty with the Kraylor.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Reopen communications if you have any questions."
