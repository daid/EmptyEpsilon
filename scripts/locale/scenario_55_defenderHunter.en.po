# Scenario description
msgid ""
"Defend home station and hunt down enemies\n"
"\n"
"Initially, you're tasked with defending your home base.  Over time, you'll "
"discover more about the enemies harassing you and you'll be ordered to find "
"and destroy the enemies responsible.  There may be various missions given "
"along the way, but the enemy harassment will continue.  You must balance "
"your two missions.\n"
"\n"
"Designed for any number of cooperating player ships. Randomization makes "
"many details different for each game, but the primary goals remain the same. "
"Untimed variations can take an hour or longer for full mission completion. "
"Different sub-missions may be chosen by the players or will be chosen at "
"random. Achieving victory in a timed hunter variation is quite a challenge. "
"Like the Waves scenario, the enemies get harder over time.\n"
