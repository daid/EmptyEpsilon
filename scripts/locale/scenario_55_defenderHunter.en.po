# Scenario description
msgid ""
"Defend home station and hunt down enemiesInitially, you're tasked with "
"defending your home base.  Over time, you'll discover more about the enemies "
"harassing you and you'll be ordered to find and destroy the enemies "
"responsible.  There may be various missions given along the way, but the "
"enemy harassment will continue.  You must balance your two missions.Designed "
"for 1-8 cooperating player ships.  Randomization makes many details "
"different for each game, but the primary goals remain the same.  Untimed "
"variations can take an hour or longer for full mission completion.  "
"Different sub-missions may be chosen by the players or will be chosen at "
"random.  Achieving victory in a timed hunter variation is quite a "
"challenge.  Like the Waves scenario, the enemies get harder over time."
"Features:- Randomly selected player ship names based on type (not just the "
"default call sign generation)- Simple mix of variations based on time and "
"difficulty- Named stations with cargo type often related to name- Some cargo "
"based missions- Mortal but replaceable at station repair crew- Asteroids and "
"nebulae in motion- Intense pacing- Player fighters may activate auto-cooling "
"and auto-repair in engineeringVersion 9 - Oct2020"
