The turbo torpedo capability takes between 55 and 90 seconds to recharge between uses. The turbo capability is currently limited to EMP, Nuke or Homing missile types and may be restricted further depending on the individual ship installation.\n\nKnown ship types with Turbo Torpedo capability:\nMantis, Focus, Fresnel")

These come in various roles.\n* Light transport: Small transports, like transporting up to 50 soldiers in spartan conditions or a few diplomats in luxury. Depending on the role it can have some weaponry.\n* Support: Support types come in many varieties. They are simply a frigate hull fitted with whatever was needed.

When he went bankrupt, the Icarus station shipyards picked it up for a song. After Cobra was crippled in early April of 2020, Mike Sandusky worked hard to salvage it or get another similar model. He had recently remade his fortune through gambling winnings. Station Sovinec, a known hub for cheap (or wrecked) hulls said they had one and Icarus Patrol was asked to try to get it in may. Sandusky paid heavily for the privilege. Alas, the hull was already gone. Finally in June, Sandusky scrounged the necessary parts and rebuilt Cobra.\n\nFor several months, he flew around showing off his restored ship. In September, CUF requisitioned the Cobra for use by Icarus Patrol. Unfortunately, Cobra did not survive the mission.

Unfortunately, Vision was destroyed during an Exuari attack during her next mission\n\nVision redeployed again in Oct2020. The Exuari activity around Icarus had risen to the point where the stations were hiring defensive fleets for protection. The Ghosts picked this mission to launch numerous fleets through a wormhole into Icarus.

Deployed as Headhunter Aug2020 for 3 missions\n\nDuring Headhunter's first string of missions, she spent time hunting Kraylor in the Fleur nebula, took part in a goodwill tour of Icarus area stations and helped defend against Kraylor who thought Icarus would be easy pickings since the bulk of the CUF fleet was on the front lines. On her 4th mission, Hunter was taken out by those same Kraylor she had valiantly fought earlier\n\nBarracuda was put on nebula investigation duty around Borlan station. After fighting several Exuari and failing to rescue station Slurry, Barracuda was recalled to defend Icarus where she was destroyed by Exuari\n\nThe Hearken deployed as a Redhook in May2020, but even with several tactical retreats was overwhelmed by Kraylor who deployed a new ship type, Tempest which was equipped with multiple nuclear weapons\n\nIn Jul2020, Barracuda redeployed for two missions. Unfortunately, Exuari destroyed her on her second mission\n\nThe Headhunter was redeployed after extensive repair in Aug2020 for 3 missions. She helped rebuild stations Gagarin, Stromboli 2 and Mermaid 4. She also helped chase down Kraylor that were towing off CUF escape pods. Unfortunately, during a mission in the Kentar region where there was some kind of viral epidemic going on, she was destroyed by a flurry of Kraylor\n\nAngus McDaniels and his salvage crew have gathered numerous parts from various Redhook class wrecks and finally brought the Barracuda back online. She deployed for 1 mission where Kraylor savaged her badly. The shipyards salvaged enough of her to use to put Hearken back in shape.")

Next mission she was called to Kentar to help repel Kraylor alongside other CUF ships Day, Night, Dawn and Dusk. On her next mission, she defened Icarus against Exuari and Ghost aggressors, then moved to kentar to fight off Kraylor. During the next mission in the Kentar area, Pinwheel fell prey to the Kraylor command base with its beam and missile defenses\n\nAngus McDaniels has requested repair parts for Pinwheel but has been told repeatedly that his request has lower priority than those sending similar parts to the maintenance facilities near the CUF/Kraylor front lines")
