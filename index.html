		<h2>What is it?</h2>
		EmptyEpsilon is a space ship bridge simulator game. It's fully open source, so it can be modified in any way people wish.
		<h2>What does this mean?</h2>
		EmptyEpsilon allows you to play a space ship bridge. Like seen in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek">Star Trek</a>. In order to play, you will need at least four people, but the best experience is with 6.
		Each person will have their own role; Captain, Helms, Tactical, Relay, Science and engineering. The captain however, does not have a screen, nor can he press any buttons (save for switching the main screen). The captain will need to rely on their trusty crew to follow his/her orders.
		<h2>Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator?</h2>
		<a href="http://www.artemis.eochu.com/">Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator</a> was the inspiration for EmptyEpsilon. It's pretty good as a bridge simulator.But we had some issues with it, which we decided to fix. As spaceship artemis isn't open source, our only solution was to start over by ourselves.
		For example, the "comms" station of Artemis is pretty limited causing that station to be boring for the player. There where also issues with the game desyncing, causing confusion among the players.
		Also the GameMaster screen pretty much did not what we wanted to see in a GameMaster screen.<br>
		So, all in all, artemis is a nice game, but we wrote our own due to lack of features.
		<h2>Contact</h2>
		<p>The best place to talk about bridge simulation and EmptyEpsilon is the <a href="http://bridgesim.net/">The Starship Bridge Simulation Network</a>. We regulary check this and post updates / battle logs of our space adventures.</p>
		<p>Main developers of EmptyEpsilon go by the names of <a href="https://github.com/daid/">Daid</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nallath/">Nallath</a></p>
		
		<h2>Donations</h2>
		<p>EmptyEpsilon is a 100% free game. We made this because we wanted to play the game we envisioned for ourselves. But we are not artists, so we need to buy the 3D models used in this game.</p>
		<p>Currently we are raising money to buy <a href="http://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/maya-5-small-frigates/828573">more frigates models</a></p>

					To run EmptyEpsilon you need the following equipment:
					<ul>
						<li>4-6 computers, depending on the number of players (laptops or desktops)</li>
						<li>One big screen (large monitor, tv or beamer)</li>
						<li>A stable network (wifi can work, but cabled network is prefered)</li>
					</ul>
					5 of the 6 computers will run "stations" these are for the players that need to control different parts of the ship.
					The last computer is for the main screen. This screen does not need any input and should be visible for all players.
				</p>
				<p>
					Designate a single player as Captain. 
					His computer can be used as main screen, and his only job is to talk with the other players and tell them what they should do.
				</p>
				<p>
					The other 5 players each man a different station. The description on what each station can (and should) do can be found at station tabs.
				</p>
				<h2>Running the game</h2>
				<p>
					After starting the game the computer selected for the main screen can best be the server. The other stations should connect as clients.
					After starting a server, and selecting a scenario (we recommend the "Waves" or "Basic" scenario for first games) you should spawn a player ship for everyone to join.
					Everyone should select the ship, choose their designated station. And you're off. Easy as pie.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="running-tabs-limited">
				<p>
					If you don't have enough players (or stations) it's possible to run multiple stations on a single machine. This can be done by pressing multiple roles in the ship selection menu. Switching between stations can be done by pressing the corresponding button in the top of the game screen.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="running-tabs-auto">
				<p>
					TODO (You can make EmptyEpsilon auto connect to any available server on the network, and selecting a station instantly. Lowering setup time)
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="running-tabs-gm">
				<p>
					TODO (You have access to a GM screen on the server, which gives you a lot of control on the game, allowing tweaks while the game is playing, making for an more intresting game)

					The captain has zero direct control of the ship. However, he is tasked with keeping the whole crew together and making tactical decisions.
					The main screen should be setup on a large monitor or beamer so it is visible for all the players.
				</p>
				<h2>The captains tasks include (but are not limited to):</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Planning the next actions</li>
					<li>Co-ordinating combat tactics</li>
					<li>Preventing mutiny</li>
					<li>Setting priorities</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Controls:</h2>
				<p>Note that these controls are optional, and do not have to be used to play the game, but could be used in custom hardware setups. These controls are only for the main screen.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Left mouse button: Rotate the main screen 90deg to the left</li>
					<li>Right mouse button: Rotate the main screen 90deg to the right</li>
					<li>Middle mouse button: Switch between ship, radar and long range radar view</li>
					<li>Up key: Set mainscreen view to forward view</li>
					<li>Down key: Set mainscreen view to rear view</li>
					<li>Left key: Set mainscreen view to left view</li>
					<li>Right key: Set mainscreen view to right view</li>
					<li>Tab key: Set mainscreen view to short range radar view</li>
					<li>Q key: Set mainscreen view to long range radar view</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Notes</h2>
				<p>
					There are a lot of ways to setup the mainscreen and captain role. You can designate a single station to give control of the main screen.
					But you can also give the captain direct control of the main screen with the above controls.
				</p>
				<p>
					A simple "custom" hardware setup for the captain would be using tape to attach a 3 button mouse to an armchair.

				<p>
					In the left upper corner you can see the energy (max is 1000), the current heading in degrees and the current speed. Below this data are two sliders; The leftmost slider sets the impulse power from -100% to 100%. The slider next to it sets the jump distance.
				</p>
<p> <b>Jumping</b> The jump button allowes the ship to jump the set distance in it's current heading. Note that the further you jump, the higher the energy cost. Depending on how much power the system has (and how damaged it is) the time to power the jump might increase/decrease. </p>
<p> <b>Docking</b> Docking can be done when the ship is within 1 km of a friendly station by pressing the dock button. </p>			</div>
